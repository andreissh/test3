# MyApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
2. Configure the values of the variables in the `.env` file (provide your API key)
3. Run the application using `npm start` to generate the environment file for using the API key in the application

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
